# Simple Calculator using Tkinter

This is a basic calculator application built using Python's Tkinter library. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for performing basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Features

- **Simple and Intuitive GUI**: Easy-to-use interface for performing calculations.
- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Error Handling**: Displays error messages for invalid operations (e.g., division by zero).
- **Clear Button**: Allows users to reset the current input.


## Installation

To run this calculator on your local machine, you need to have Python installed. Follow the steps below to set up and run the application:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AkhilaReddy9/SimpleCalculator-using-tkinter-python.git
   cd simple-tkinter-calculator
   ```

2. **Install the required dependencies**:
   No additional packages are required beyond Tkinter, which comes with standard Python installations. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

3. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   python SimpleCalculator.py
   ```

## Usage

1. **Launching the Calculator**:
   Run the `SimpleCalculator.py` script. A calculator window will appear.

2. **Performing Calculations**:
   - Use the number buttons (`0-9`) to enter numbers.
   - Use the operator buttons (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) to perform operations and square root, exponentiation, memory functions
   - Click `=` to get the result.
   - Click `C` to clear the current input.


- This project was inspired by various online tutorials and the need for a simple calculator application.
- Thanks to the contributors of the Tkinter library for providing an excellent tool for building GUIs in Python.
